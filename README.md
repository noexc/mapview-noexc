# mapview-noexc

This repository contains modules that aren't core to mapview's functionality,
but are useful on NOEXC flights. It also contains our NOEXC flight
mapview configuration files (which are just Haskell programs).

It is only useful with mapview 3.0+, which is still a huge work in progress and
does not actually work yet.

For near upcoming flights, we plan on using version >= 2, < 3, while work on
mapview 3 is ongoing.

Basically: Unless you're interested in hacking on mapview, you won't find this
repository useful right now.

That said, everything in it is released under the MIT license.
